<h3 style="color: black;"><b>1.what is chemical reaction ?</b></h3>
  <p><i>Answer : chemical reaction is change in whivh their two or more substances reacts to become new substances  and it is irreversable change.</i></p>
<h3 style="color: black;"><b>2.what are the changes are observed when chemical reaction takes place ?</b></h3>
  <p><i>
     <pre>Answer : a  change in state</pre>
     <pre>         b  change in state </pre>
     <pre>         c  change in temperature</pre>
     <pre>         d  formation of presipitate</pre>
  </i></p>
       <h3 style="color: black;" background-color="tomato"><b>3.what are the types of reaction ?</b></h3>
  <pre>there are 6 types of reaction are - </pre>
                 <pre><i>a  combination reaction</i>: in this the many reactants form single product.</pre>
                                       <em>Example : 2MgO + O2 = 2MgO</em>
                 <pre><i>b  decomposition reactions</i>: in this the single reactants form many product</pre> 
                                       <mark>Example : 2MgO = 2Mg + O2</mark>
                 <pre><i>c  displacement reactions</i> : in this the low reactive materials element exchange from high reactive materials element.</pre>
                                       <b>Example : Fe + CuSo4 = FeSo4</b>
                 <pre><i>d  double displacement reactions</i> :in this reactions exchange their ions from their own compounds </pre>
                                       <sub>Example : Na2So4 + BaCl2 = 2NaCl + BaSo4</sub>
                 <pre><i>e  exothermic reactions</i> =in which reactions which release heat after reacting </pre>
                                       Example : CaCO3 = Cao + CO2 + heat                 
                 <pre><i>f  electrolysis reactions </i>: in this reactions which release electricity after reacting</pre> 
                                       Example : 2NaCl + 2H2O = 2NaOH + H2
                 <pre><i>g  redox reactions</i> : in this reation the both oxidation and reduction takes place in the same reaction </pre>
                                       Example : ZnO + C = ZnO + CO
